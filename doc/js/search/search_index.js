directives in action at https://michaeldoye.github.io/mat-markdown-editor\nDependencies\n\nAngular (requires Angular 2 or higher, tested with 2.0.0)\nAngular Material\n\nInstallation\nInstall above dependencies via npm. \nNow install mat-markdown-editor via:\nshell\nnpm install --save mat-markdown-editor\nAdd the following to your index.html (or configure via angular-cli.json)\n* Marked JS\n* Hightlight JS\n* Ace Editor\n```html\n\n\n\n```\n\nSystemJS\n\nNote:If you are using SystemJS, you should adjust your configuration to point to the UMD bundle.\nIn your systemjs config file, map needs to tell the System loader where to look for mat-markdown-editor:\n```js\nmap: {\n  'mat-markdown-editor': 'node_modules/mat-markdown-editor/bundles/mat-markdown-editor.umd.js',\n}\n\n```\nOnce installed you need to import the main module:\njs\nimport { MatMarkdownEditorModule } from 'mat-markdown-editor';\nThe only remaining part is to list the imported module in your application module. The exact method will be slightly\ndifferent for the root (top-level) module for which you should end up with the code similar to (notice MatMarkdownEditorModule.forRoot()):\n```js\nimport { MatMarkdownEditorModule } from 'mat-markdown-editor';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [AppComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatMarkdownEditorModule.forRoot(), ...],  bootstrap: [AppComponent]\n})\nexport class AppModule {\n}\n```\nOther modules in your application can simply import MatMarkdownEditorModule:\n```js\nimport { MatMarkdownEditorModule } from 'mat-markdown-editor';\n@NgModule({\n  declarations: [OtherComponent, ...],\n  imports: [MatMarkdownEditorModule, ...], \n})\nexport class OtherModule {\n}\n```\nUsage\n```js\nimport { Component } from '@angular/core';\nimport { MatMarkdownEditorOptions } from 'mat-markdown-editor';\n@Component({\n  selector: 'app-home',\n  template: \n        \n        \n      ,\n})\nexport class HomeComponent {\n  public options: MatMarkdownEditorOptions = {\n    enablePreviewContentClick: false,\n    resizable: true,\n    showBorder: true,\n    hideIcons: {},\n    hideToolbar: false,\n    height: '500px',\n    mode: 'editor',\n    toolbarColor: 'primary',\n    preRender: this.preRender,\n  };\n  preRender(markDown: any) {\n    // Here you have access to the markdown binding\n    // before it is rendered\n    return markDown;\n  }\n}\n```\nAll options can be found here\n\n\nRun Demo App Locally\n\nclone this repo by running\nbash\n$ git clone https://github.com/michaeldoye/mat-markdown-editor.git\n\nlink the mat-markdown-editor package\n\n\nbash\n$ gulp link\n\nnavigate to the demo app directory\nbash\n$ cd demo\n\ninstall the dependencies\nbash\n$ npm i\n\nrun/start/serve the app\nbash\n$ npm run start\nor\nbash\n$ ng serve --open\n\nthe app is now hosted by http://localhost:4200/\n\n\n\n\nDevelopment\n\nclone this repo\nInstall the dependencies by running npm i\nbuild the library npm run build or gulp build\nLink the library gulp link\nNavigate to the demo app's directory\n\n\ncd demo\n_ npm i\n_ npm start\n\n\n\nLicense\nCopyright (c) 2019 Michael Doye.
